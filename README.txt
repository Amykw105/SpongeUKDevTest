Sponge UK Developer Test

In order to run this test, you must either host this project on a web server or enable local file execution in your browser. To enable the requests with the protocol of `file:///`, please follow the instructions on https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally.

For this test, you will need:

* An IDE of your choice (e.g. Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3))
* A web browser (e.g. Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/))
* An image editing application (e.g. Photoshop or GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/))
* A copy of Microsoft Word (for opening the example text - you may be able to use Google Docs (https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/) instead)

If you can't change your browser settings to allow locally-hosted files, you will also need a local web server:

* WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) - Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP
* MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/) - Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP
* Fenix (http://fenixwebserver.com/)
* LightTPD (http://www.lighttpd.net/)
